Coffee Sales Performance Dashboard

Attached the dataset used for creating the interactive dashboard using Power BI for business stakeholders

Steps Performed:
Loaded the dataset into the power query editor of Power BI and cleaned the data like removing the whitespace, changing the datatype, etc.
Created one calendar table to get the month and day names chronologically.
Established the relationship between the calendar table and the transactions table.
Created measures to calculate total sales, Last month's sales, MOM change, total footfall, average bill per person, etc.
Added slicers on a month and day basis to interact with the dashboard.

I created one PowerPoint summary to show the insights gained from the analysis and some suggestions that can be implemented to improve business.
